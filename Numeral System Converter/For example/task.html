<p>If you don't know what a numeral system is, please take time to read through the relevant <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">Wikipedia</a> page. Also, there is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2zsmYaI5ww" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">great Youtube video</a> that explains various numeral systems and the relationship between them.</p>

<p>The goal for now is to implement a program that outputs a number in two systems: the first is decimal, and the second is binary. It must the <strong>same </strong>number represented in two different systems. Feel free to choose any number you like.</p>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you output a single line;</li>
	<li>there are two numbers;</li>
	<li>the first number is decimal;</li>
	<li>the second number is binary (it starts with <code class="java">0b</code> and contains only <code class="java">0</code> and <code class="java">1</code>);</li>
	<li>the first number is equal to the second one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you do not need to enter anything into the program, you should print a line prepared in advance.<strong> </strong>A single String is expected to be printed.</p>
